    "introduction":"Orphaned at a young age, Archi grew up in Spain and bounced around orphanages until he was adopted by a master pianist, Silvio. Archi was the apprentice to his new parent and had a natural gift for music. Unfortunately being a pianist doesn't make you wealthy and his teacher had a debt with the local mob. When Silvio was unable to pay his debt, the mob took Archi as leverage. Silvio became desperate but was still unable to come up with the cash. In an attempt to rescue Archi, Silvio guaranteed his death. The mobsters locked Archi in a piano and tossed it into the sea. As he sunk, Archi violently struggled to break free, hitting all the strings and setting off so much noise within the piano. The deeper he got the more he screamed and fought but the pressure of the deep sea compressed his struggle, but then the compression forced the vibrations of his yelling and the piano into his body and manipulated his DNA. As Archi continued to fight, his body began to vibrate to a speed that allowed him to pass through his restraints and through the Piano and he launched himself to the surface. In awe of what had happened, Archi rushed back to tell his father, only to find Silvio murdered in their home. Through his frustration and grief Archi realized that what had happened to him in that piano not only left him with the ability to manipulate sound waves, but also left him deaf. Although he could no longer hear, he could still feel the vibration from sound all around him and through him. Frustrated and vengeful, Archi tracked down and confronted the mob and in a fit of rage let out a piercing screech which left them deaf, dumb, and blind, bleeding from their ears and eyes. Archi developed his powers so that he could focus his energy through his hands and voice, producing waves of vibration that could move objects, cripple others (mentally through pitch), mimic voices and sounds, pass through objects, and even fly, with the right gear. As no stranger to the corruption and violence that he faced before his adoption, Archi swore to protect those who could not protect themselves and took on the alter ego \"Sordo\" meaning deaf in Spanish. Also having been introduced to the high end lifestyles through his performances with Silvio, Archi has been able to maintain his image as a pianist. His suit consists of a black wing suit/cape (similar to Batman) that allows him to fly, and the rest of his costume is a black suit and bowtie, just like a pianist and a full cover white mask (similar to Spiderman, but without any eyes or patterns. He has a slender but muscular build.",

    "introduction":"Eve is a bio mechanical engineer for the US Government. She worked for 2 decades developing technology that allowed soldiers injured in battle to gain bio-mechanical limbs which not only restored their bodies but enhanced their speed, reflexes and strength to make them better soldiers. Eventually, Eve began a new set of research that would allow mechanical devices that could restore and enhance senses such as site and hearing to allow those with disabilities to to serve in combat and provide the government with a wider pool of soldiers. Just as she was reaching a breakthrough discovery, Dr. Eve began to experience headaches, light sensitivity and vision lost. After loosing her ability to stand bright light at all, Dr. Eve went into the infirmary on base to discover that she had a degenerative eye disease that would eventually take away her sight completely. Determined to take this matter into her own hands, Eve worked tirelessly to create a prototype of the glasses she'd invented to restore vision. When she was finished she cautiously tested the device on her own face. Once activated, Dr. Eve was horrified to find that the glasses were emitting a strange purple smoke and felt like they were cemented to her face. Panicked, she looked around the lab for a way to pry them off but then realized that the room appeared pitch black but she could see everything. Her vision had no been restored but somehow she was able to create darkness her and therefore be able to see using night vision through the glasses.",
